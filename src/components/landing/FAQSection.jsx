  {
    q: "What is Zelion?",
    a: "Zelion is an infrastructure-first technology initiative focused on real-world energy validation, deterministic processing, and long-term system deployment. The network bridges physical energy systems, decentralized infrastructure, and blockchain-based coordination through verifiable data integrity and hardware-level validation mechanisms.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why infrastructure before token?",
    a: "Most blockchain projects begin with tokens and attempt to later attach utility. Zelion reverses this approach by beginning with infrastructure, hardware validation, and real-world system integration. The token exists only as a coordination and alignment layer within the ecosystem.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the $ZLN token do?",
    a: "$ZLN is a utility and coordination instrument. Primary utilities include participation in validator coordination mechanisms, access to ecosystem-level infrastructure services, alignment of long-term contributors, and governance signaling for protocol-level decisions. The token does not represent equity, ownership, or profit-sharing.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does hardware validation work?",
    a: "Zelion integrates hardware-based validators designed to capture real-world energy-related data, perform local integrity verification, and prevent manipulation before data enters digital systems. By validating data at the physical source, Zelion reduces attack surfaces and improves data reliability.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the role of blockchain in Zelion?",
    a: "In the Zelion ecosystem, blockchain is used for validator coordination, infrastructure alignment, and ecosystem transparency. Blockchain does not control physical infrastructure—it records validated outcomes produced by infrastructure-level processes, improving resilience and scalability.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Zelion an investment?",
    a: "No. Zelion is infrastructure technology designed for long-term deployment, real-world infrastructure integration, and institutional compatibility. Participation in decentralized infrastructure systems involves risk, and no guarantees are made regarding performance, adoption, or outcomes. Users should conduct independent research before participating.",
